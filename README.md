# This is a simple comparison of EF Core and Dapper for CRUD operations.

- EF Core is more faster for READ
- EF Core is more faster for UPDATE

- Dapper is more faster for DELETE
- Dapper is more faster for CREATE


## 🆚 Dapper vs EF Core – Which One to Use?

### 🔹 Dapper
**Dapper** is a lightweight and high-performance micro-ORM that allows direct execution of SQL queries with minimal overhead. It's best suited for scenarios where you need full control over the SQL and care deeply about performance.

**✅ Use Dapper when:**
- You want full control over SQL queries.
- You need high performance (e.g., APIs, reporting tools).
- You're building a small app or microservice.
- You are comfortable writing SQL manually.

**📌 Ideal for:**
- High-speed REST APIs
- Microservices
- Reporting tools
- Lightweight apps

### 🔹 Entity Framework Core (EF Core)
**EF Core** is a full-featured ORM that enables you to work with a database using C# objects and LINQ. It handles SQL generation, change tracking, and migrations, making it ideal for more complex and scalable applications.

**✅ Use EF Core when:**
- You want to avoid writing raw SQL.
- Your application has complex relationships and logic.
- You need quick development with model-driven design.
- You need features like change tracking and migrations.

**📌 Ideal for:**
- Business applications (e.g., HR, CRM)
- Admin panels
- Medium to large-scale web applications
- Projects that evolve over time

| Feature            | Dapper                        | EF Core                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Performance        | ✅ Very Fast                   | ⚠️ Fast, but slower than Dapper    |
| Query Writing      | Manual SQL                    | LINQ (Auto SQL generation)        |
| Learning Curve     | Easy (if you know SQL)        | Moderate                          |
| Complex Relationships | Manual handling          | Built-in navigation support       |
| Development Speed  | Slower (more boilerplate)     | Faster (less code for CRUD)       |
| Best For           | Performance-critical scenarios| Scalable and maintainable apps    |
